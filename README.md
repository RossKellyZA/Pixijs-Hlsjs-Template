Pixi.js + Hls.js + Webpack + Babel

A minimal starting point for experiments with Pixi.js adn Hls.js using Webpack and Babel to get the latest ES features.

## Usage

1) `npm install` - install dependencies 
2) `npm start` - start the development server
or
3) `npm build` - build a deployable bundle

The entry point is `src/index.js` which already has a Pixi.js and Hls.js app initialized.

### Assets

All assets are placed in the `src/assets/` directory and will be available to the app at `assets/`.

* `npm run start` - start the development server
* `npm run build` - build a deployable bundle
* `npm run reinit` - after cloning the repo, run this command to re-initialize the repository for your own project
